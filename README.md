# diffMIN
The algorithm is computationally intensive, and we recommend using multithreaded operations
48 CPU and 200G memory is enough in this example
foreground network are recommended to compute divided into some batches so we recommend running the work in the background of the system

# data downloading and preprocess
Data downloading and preprocess can be followed by file '0Data_download_and_preprocess.R'

# construct diffMINs
Construct diffMINs can be followed by files from '_1' to '_7' or 'code.sh'

# Transform GEM to DEM
Transform GEM to DEM can be followed by files '8Transform GEM to DEM.R'
